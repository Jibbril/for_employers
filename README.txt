The files here are parts of applications that I've built. They serve as an example of the kind of programming I've been doing.

Every script has a short introductory comment at the top of the page that explains what it does. this is intended
specifically for you reading this and is not a regular part of the program.

If you would like to see more code, or whole programs, just let me know and I'll provide it.
