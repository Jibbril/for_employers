The files here are parts of programs that I've written. They serve as an example of the kind of programming I've been doing.
I would recommend starting in the winstock script in the python folder but feel free to look around.

Every file has a short introductory comment at the top of the page that explains what the file does, this is intended
specifically for you reading this and is not a regular part of the program.

If you would like to see more or whole programs then just let me know and I'll provide it.
